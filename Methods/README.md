The Methods-C ++, Methods-Java, and Methods-Python directories have the source code for 100 methods. The methods are the same in each directory, but they are written in a different programming language. Some of those methods are from our own implementation and others are from the following open source libraries:

- Colt Project (http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/): Open-source libraries written for high-performance scientific and technical computing in Java.
- Apache Mahout (https://mahout.apache.org/): ML library written in \textit{Java}.
- Apache Commons Mathematics (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/): Library of mathematics and statistics components written in the Java.
- Java Collections (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/Collection.html): Framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
- NumPy (https://numpy.org/)Package for scientific computing in Python.
- Blinz++ (https://github.com/blitzpp/blitzl): High-performance multidimensional array library for scientific computing written C++.

The file "Methods.PNG" details the methods used and specifies the library that they belong to or if is own implementation. Also, it specifies which MR mathes each method. We use the "1" to denote a method that matches a given MR, and "0" to denote a method that does not fulfil a particular MR. If the change in the output is as predicted after altering the original input, the method 'm' is said to fulfil (or satisfies) an MR.
